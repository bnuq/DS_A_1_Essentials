DP, Dynamic Programming
	DP is all about Remembering what you have solved in the past

Memoization

Top Down DP = Recursion + Memoization
	Start from top
	Start building the big solution by explaing how you build it from smaller solutions


Bottom UP DP = Iterative
	Start with small solutions and use it to build larger solutions


Greedy
	매번 선택에서, 가장 이득이 되는 경우를 선택한다
